   ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-yellow?logo=javascript)
   
**DetectNQI** is a lightweight JavaScript utility to detect the **Network Quality Index (NQI)** based on round-trip time (RTT) to download a small static resource. It classifies the connection into a gear rating from **1 (slow)** to **10 (fast)**, which can be used to adapt application behavior based on current network conditions.

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone or copy the file directly into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poen0121/nqi.git
```

Or manually download the `nqi.js` file and place it in your project along with a file named `nqi.dat`.

> ⚠️ `nqi.dat` must be a static file hosted alongside `nqi.js` for accurate RTT measurement.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```js
import { DetectNQI } from './nqi.js';

(async () => {
  const result = await DetectNQI({ debug: true });
  console.log(result);
  // Example output: { rtt: "142.35", gear: 8 }
})();
```

### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Default | Description                          |
|--------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| debug  | Boolean | `false` | Enable console logging for debugging |

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to an object:

```ts
{
  rtt: string | null,  // RTT in milliseconds (string format)
  gear: number         // Gear level from 0 (no signal) to 10 (very fast)
}
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
nqi/
├── nqi.js   // Main script
└── nqi.dat  // Small static file for RTT test
```

> `nqi.dat` can be any small static file (e.g., empty `.dat` or `.txt`) used to measure download time.

---

## 🧪 Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to log detailed info to the browser console:

```js
await DetectNQI({ debug: true });
// Console output:
// NQI: rtt=83.12 ms, gear=9
```
